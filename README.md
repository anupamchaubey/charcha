ðŸ’¬ Charcha â€“ Anonymous Regional Chat App (Spring Boot + MongoDB)

â€¢ Built a region-based anonymous group chat backend allowing users to auto-join public chats based on their region (e.g., by pincode).
â€¢ Designed REST APIs and integrated MongoDB for scalable message storage and region-based filtering.
